|  508 | Most Frequent Subtree Sum             | Medium       | Use a hash table to find all path sums, and then find answer from the hash table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [PySolution](./leetcode_python_solutions/508.py) |                                              |

Check out similar problem 560.                                                                                                                                                                              | [PySolution](./leetcode_python_solutions/437.py) | 113, 129, 257                                |
|  124 | Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum          | Hard/Medium  | Find left sum and right sum, and use both of them to calculate the sum with the current node as the root, and return only one of them.                                                                                                                                                                           | [PySolution](./leetcode_python_solutions/124.py) | 543                                          |
|  572 | Subtree of Another Tree               | Easy/Medium  | Recursively check if t is the same tree with a tree rooted at the current node, or if t is a subtree rooted at current node's left or right child. Problem 687 can have linear time complexity by calculating the longest path by using left and right paths and only returning the max of left and right paths. | [PySolution](./leetcode_python_solutions/572.py) | 687                                          |
|  102 | Binary Tree Level Order Traversal     | Medium       | Level-order traversal. Use BFS or defaultdict[list] to add node into corresponding level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [PySolution](./leetcode_python_solutions/102.py) | 637, 513, 429, 1302                          |
|  144 | Binary Tree Preorder Traversal        | Medium       | Recursively is trivial, but iteratively is very complicated. IMO, iteratively in-order traversal is the hardest.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [PySolution](./leetcode_python_solutions/144.py) | 589, 145, 590, 94                            |
|  297 | Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree | Hard         | In the binary tree problem, we need to have "null" indicator to represent null node in the serialized string, while BST does not. BST problem uses pre-order traversal to serialize and deserialize by recursively building trees by checking lower and upper bounds for subtrees.                               | [PySolution](./leetcode_python_solutions/297.py) | 449, 106, 105                                |
